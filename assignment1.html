    <!--
      In this section (<body>), create a h1 tag stating your name
      Beneath that, create an unordered list with at least 3 list items
      that describe your web development experience (if any, it's ok if this is all new :D)

      This is just a quick exercise to show that you know how to work with git and GitHub
      No styling or scripting is required for this assignment

      If you don't know how to make the above mentioned tags, either take a look around on
      the internet, or don't hesitate to ask me!

    <h4>My Web Development Experience</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>I don't really have much experience whatsoever with actual web development. I'm taking this class because I
        thought that as a computer science major, web programming would probably be a decent skill to have.</li>
      <li>This past summer I worked as an intern at a financial services company. One of the things I did while there
        was develop a GUI-based java application using JavaFX. The user interface elements were defined in FXML
        (Does that count?).</li>
      <li>As part of the development used CSS very briefly because I wanted to modify the default font.
        Also, all the buttons in the app were gray and boring and I wanted to make them blue with a gradient.</li>
      <li>Part of the app's functionality required a user to log in and for data about a given user to be stored/accessed,
        so I needed the app to access a MySQL server. I wrote several PHP files to communicate with the server.
        To be completely honest, I had no idea what I was doing and figured everything out on the fly by searching
        Google repeatedly.</li>
    </ul>
